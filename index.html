    <h2>Oh hey! I'm Leo :)</h2>
    <p>I’m a person who believes in innovation and using technology as a tool to inspire and help others. Through the years, I’ve used my fascination with tech to fuel me to experiment and push my limits. I’ve learned to be curious and never back down from a challenge. This website shows some examples where curiosity didn't kill the cat (me), and I made things that I personally think are pretty cool.</p>

    <h3> Projects </h3>
    <p> I'm currently working on my A-Level Computer Science project, named ApexOS, A lightweight, modular OS simulation aimed at individuals looking to learn the basics of Linux and its commands and filesystem.</p>

        As you can tell, this is a work in progress. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my own enjoyment, so it may take a while for me to finish this.
