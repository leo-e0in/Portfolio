        I’m a person who believes in innovation and using technology as a tool to inspire and help others. Since I can remember I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how it works and through the years I’ve used that fascination to fuel me to experiment and push my limits, I’ve learned to be curious and never back down from a challenge, this website shows some examples where curiosity didn't kill the cat (me) and I made things that I personally think are pretty cool.</p>
        
        <p> In recent years I've become interested in cybersecurity and penetration testing. I'm currently learning the basics and using my base knowledge from my previous experience below to guide me.</p>
<h3>
        <p> I've been learning Python for now 4 years from my GCSE Computer Science qualification and also from me currently doing A-Level Computer Science which I have to complete a programming project for, I will share this on this portfolio when It's complete and I'ts been marked. </p>

        As you can tell, this is a work in progress, I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and Java Script for my own enjoyment so it make take a while for me to finish this.
